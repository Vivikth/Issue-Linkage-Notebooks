# Issue-Linkage-Notebooks
Code used to create contour plots and figures for issue linkage paper

Due to (most likely) interdependency issues, Pacal does not work with Python 3.x. As such, in order to run these notebooks sucessfully, you will need to downgrade to python 2.7.x. I used conda 4.7.12 to create these files, so the notebooks should run smoothly on conda 4.7.12.

I'll put a link to the paper once it's published / available online.
